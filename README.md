For experimenting several data engineering practices used for preparing data from different sources into formats which are easily and readily available for descriptive and predictive analysis.


### Requirements
1. SQL
2. Python3
3. Pandas



###  Contents
This repo contains 3 folders which seperately analyze different data modeling schemes
1. [Relational_DBMS](###Relational_DBMS)
2. [NoSQL](###NoSQL)
3. [Data_Warehousing](###Data_Warehousing)



#### Relational_DBMS

The relational DB section entails the management of structured and relational database systems using SQL (Structured Query Language) for the database querying and maintainance. Here, the postgresql engine is used for Data modeling operations which entails: Tables creation, Joins, Normalization, Denormalization, Schema, Warehousing

Requirements: 'python3', 'postgre', 'sql', 'pandas', 'numpy' and 'json' ..
